## 3.Find the result
  - After we run paired t-test, the result we got is ***"there is no difference between blue and pink liking"***
 
 TIP! : why paired t-test? Because paired t-test used when we are interested in the difference between two variables for the same subject or the mean difference between paired observations (dependent). In this case, we ask participants (a same subject) to rate 1 to 5 both blue and pink (paired observations).
